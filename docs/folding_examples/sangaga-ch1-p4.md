    (Consciousness Rooted in Ill-will or Aversion)
    One consciousness, unprompted, accompanied by displeasure, connected with ill-will
    One consciousness, prompted, accompanied by displeasure, connected with ill-will

    One consciousness, accompanied by indifference, and connected with doubts,
