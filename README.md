# Sutta Folding Project

## An exercise in Abdhidhamma using Natural Language Processing

---

## Context

The _Suttas_ are discourses of the Buddha. In [Theravāda Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theravada), they have been recorded into the [Pali Canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81li_Canon). When reading those, one is striken by how sometimes they are highly structured, showing patterns. These patterns actually derive from the oral tradition they emerged from: they have this format because they are easier to remember and recreate, based on [_matikas_](docs/matikas.md) (compiled lists of concepts).

## Objective

This project has two objectives, each have an opposite direction:

- UNFOLD: be able to generate suttas automatically from matikas and a template form
- FOLD: be able to detect the matikas suttas are made of, and compile them in a template form


## Credits

Thanks to SuttaCentral for being.
